# ShredSite 
Welcome to Shred! 

To get things started you are going to have to have to get all the packages set up:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

You are also going to need to run two servers: our django backend and our react frontend

to run the react frontend open a terminal, and cd into the frontend directory. once there run: 
`npm start`

in a seperate terminal, cd into the shred directory and run:

`python manage.py runserver`
